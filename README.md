# Coffee-sales-data-Excel

I recently had the opportunity to work on a project featured on YouTube by WsCube Tech, which I found to be an excellent resource for learning the fundamentals of data analysis. Although it was a small project, it was incredibly valuable for getting started in the field. I'm looking forward to tackling more projects in the future and continuing to explore the exciting world of data analysis!

Let me know if you'd like any further adjustments!

Problems solved in this project here:

1: How do sales vary day by day of the week and hour of the day?
2: What is the total sales revenue for each month?
3: Are there any peak times for sales activity?
4: How do sales vary across different store locations?
5: What is the average price/order per person?
6: Which products are the bestselling in terms of quantity and revenue?
7: How do sales vary by product category and type?
